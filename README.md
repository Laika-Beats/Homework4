Timed Multiple Choice Quiz

Press start button to run quiz. Quiz has a countdown timer that also represents the user score. If the user gets a answer incorrect, time is subtracted from the countdown/score. After the last question the user is able to save their score with their initials. Score page also displays the last score.

Usually I detail how I built my code in the readme but this time I commeneted it directly in the code.

I'm still having troubles with local storage and couldn't figure out how to store the score/time without having the user type it in. I tried putting the time left in a variable in referencing in it but couldn't get it to work. If anyone has a good reference I can look at on storing scores I'd appreciate it. I also wasn't able to get more than 1 stored score to dislay, as well. Other than that I feel like I was able to understand and excute the other code concepts used in this quiz.

This is the pseudo code I wrote out before starting to code:
// Click start button [X]
//display countdown timer and hide start button [X]
//dislay question and answer buttons [X]
//user clicks answer button [X]
//incorrect answer subtracts time and moves to next question [X]
//correct question moves to next question [X]
//next question/answers are prompted [X]
//once all questions have been answered stop timer [X]
//show high score container with what was left on timer and option to save and view previous scores [X]
